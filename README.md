This mod adds the iconic "Wasted", "Busted" and "Mission Passed" screens to Grand Theft Auto IV. It is a fork of the "Mission Passed V Style" mod created by SocialOfficer (https://www.gtagaming.com/mission-passed-v-style-f26550.html).

# Features:
- Adds "Wasted" and "Busted" screens when you die or get arrested, respectively.
- Displays a "Mission Passed" screen when you complete a mission.
- Uses a design similar to GTA V.

# Help Needed:
Due to my lack of experience in creating this type of script, I need help from people with more knowledge to improve it. The desired improvements include:
- Add animations to the titles to make them more impactful and visually appealing.
- Implement a "Mission Failed" screen for when you fail a mission.
- Add visual effects similar to GTA V.
- Allow the titles to be displayed in different languages.
- Ensure that the mod works on all episodes of the game, except for the "Mission Passed" screen in The Ballad of Gay Tony.

# Resources:
The mod's source code includes the .psd file of the title images.

Anyone with experience in GTA IV scripting is invited to collaborate on improving this mod. Your help is greatly appreciated!
